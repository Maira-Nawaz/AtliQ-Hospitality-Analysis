## Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

## Datasets Used

1. `dim_date.csv` – Date, day types, week number, etc.  
2. `dim_hotels.csv` – Hotel IDs, names, city, and category  
3. `dim_rooms.csv` – Room types and classes  
4. `fact_bookings.csv` – Detailed booking transactions  
5. `fact_aggregated_bookings.csv` – Aggregated bookings by room and property


## Major Insights

- Mumbai leads in revenue; AtliQ Seasons underperforms in both revenue and ratings  
- Weekdays have higher occupancy than weekends (opposite of expected trend)  
- Elite rooms are popular but have high cancellations; Presidential rooms underutilized  
- Most bookings come from the “Others” platform; branded platforms need optimization

## Recommendations

- Improve service quality in low-performing hotels  
- Revise weekend pricing and run promotional offers  
- Strengthen presence on booking platforms like MakeMyTrip  
- Collect and act on customer feedback for low-rated properties  
- Reduce cancellations in Elite room category  
- Use calendar and weekly trend data for better operational decisions
